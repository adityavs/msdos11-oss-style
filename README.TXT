MS-DOS v1.1 and MS-DOS v2.0 source code.

This is *NOT* the original source files released by the
computer museum. For those files, please visit:

http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/

This copy of the source code is a "fork" that attempts to translate the
assembly language and object files into something that can be assembled
and built using open source tools instead of the Microsoft assembler
and linker, while producing binary exact or functionally equivalent
output. Any functional changes or added features will be clearly marked
and kept separate from the original code.

It is hoped that by doing so, the MS-DOS source code can become more
"hackable" and a better historical study guide, as being able to compile
from source and run the result is far better than just having source
code.
